.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mfw
[\fI\,FILE\/\fR]
[\fI\,command\/\fR
[\fI\,args...\/\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Watch a file, running the given command whenever said file updates.
.PP
The command is executed by
.BR system ()
and thus has all of its aspects and caveats.
For example, your shell alias will not be run.
.PP
Occasionally, some commands ran through \fBmfw\fR will require user
input, such as a compile failure in \fBpdftex\fR. When this
occurs, send user input as normal; in particular, \fBpdftex\fR
would need a \fB^D\fR\| (an EOF,
typically Control+D) to continue.

Send \fB^C\fR\| (SIGINT, often Control+C) to quit.
